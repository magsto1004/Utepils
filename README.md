# Utepils

This project was a part of IN200 - Software engineering, a subject at the University of Oslo. Me and five fellow student designed and developed an app for android over three months, that allows users to locate and view information about local bars, as well as check the weather and receive a selection of drinks that fit the weather of the chosen day. The project was centered around agile project methodology, and used Kotlin as a tool for development.

## Design process

Before starting the development process we conducted a thorough design process, using the first few weeks of the project to exclusively gather insight into the user base through a series of interviews, workshops and focus groups. During this period we also started developing a design system, and several low-fidelity prototypes that served as the foundation as we moved on to the development process.

## Technologies

We used Kotlin as our main development tool, and decided to utilize Jetpack Compose over xml to design functional, reusable components for our app.
